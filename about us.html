        <h2>THE HEART OF THE FOUNDERS</h2>
        <p>We established the Apollo English Centre in 1995 with the mission of training the young Vietnamese generation
            to
            become global citizens to promote prosperity and help them change the world for the better. For us, the
            biggest
            reward
            is seeing people's lives become better thanks to the efforts and enthusiasm of the talented teachers at
            Apollo.
            We
            hope to be able to help more students at Apollo English "Where the best become better".</p>
